# Sentiment Analysis using Tweets (NLP Project)
Use natural language processing for conducting sentiment analysis on tweets.

1. Preprocessing
    Tweets must be preprocessed before we can conduct sentiment analysis. This means tokenization, lowercasing, stemming, and removing stopwords and punctuation.

2. Feature Extraction
     Using word frequency, get the number of times a word appears in a tweet compared to our vocabulary of words. In other words, we will convert the text into numerical representation [Bias, sum of positive frequencies, sum of negative frequencies] or a matrix (X).
